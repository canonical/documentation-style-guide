# Canonical documentation style guide

This repository contains the documentation and the Vale rules for the documentation style guide.

The style guide itself is written in Markdown and contained in the `en` directory.

It is published online at: [docs.ubuntu.com/en/styleguide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en)

## The Vale rules

The Vale linter operates from a series of rules. These are defined in individual YAML files, grouped into 'Styles'.
This repository contains the Canonical set of rules, or the Canonical Style. 

### Adding to the rules

Anyone is welcome to submit a PR to add additional rules. However, no additions will be considered unless they are part of the Canonical Style Guide as found at the website above.

For a reference on rule syntax, see the Vale [documentation on Styles][Vale styles].

If you are completely new to developing Vale rules, see this [introductory guide](https://github.com/canonical/praecepta/blob/8c7fee862b2258c692439ef430198e393bdc30c4/getting-started.md). 

### Using the rules

The Vale rules are published here so that they can be used in any workflow anywhere. You can run Vale locally, as part of CI or in a GitHub workflow - all you need is Vale, a configuration file (which you can also copy from this repository) and the Canonical Styles. Two common scenarios are also catered for more directly here, as detailed below.

## The Canonical Style GitHub action

This repository also includes a file, `action.yml`, which is the basis of a GitHub action to automatically run Vale checks on incoming pull requests. 

### Using the GitHub action in a workflow

Your repository can make use of the action in a workflow. An example workflow is included in this repository and is demonstrated here. Note that the style guide action is merely part of a functioning workflow.

```yaml
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  vale:
    name: Style checker
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    defaults:
        run:
            shell: bash
            working-directory: .
    steps:
        - name: Checkout repo to runner
          uses: actions/checkout@v3
        - name: Install styles
          uses: canonical/praecepta@main
        - name: Run Vale tests
          uses: errata-ai/vale-action@reviewdog
          with:
            files: ./docs
            fail_on_error: true
```

In the example above, the workflow is organised as a single job. This is important as the actions rely on persistence through the run.
There are three job steps:
 - The github/checkout action: this fetches the code from the repo calling the workflow
 - The style guide action: this fetches the styles and, if not present, a default config for Vale. The example fetches from the main branch since rules are currently under active development.
 - The vale/reviewdog action: this runs Vale using reviewdog, to insert comments into a pull-request

 This workflow uses reviewdog to insert output into review comments on any changes. The advantage of this method is:
  - the actions only run on new material (i.e. stuff added in the current PR)
  - it is surfaced directly where it will be noticed
