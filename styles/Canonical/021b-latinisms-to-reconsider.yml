# 021 - Latinisms that we strongly advise against
# Since Vale substitutions can't ignore word boundaries, meaning they can't detect the punctuation in "i.e." and "&c", we merely check for them and then notify the user.

message: |
  Instead of Latin abbreviations, consider using an English equivalent.
  Try not to use '&c', 'e.g.', 'i.e.', or 'n.b.'.
  For 'a.m.', 'AM', 'p.m.', and 'PM', use 24-hour time.
